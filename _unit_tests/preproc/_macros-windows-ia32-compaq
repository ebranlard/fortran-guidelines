When using dec directive, the follwoing can be used to detect compaq:
_DF_VERSION_

But when using the cpreprocessor, this is not defined, so it's best to explicitly define it!

When only using the Fortran preprocessor FPP, to request that symbol values
defined by /define apply only to FPP and are not seen by compiler directives,
also specify /nodefine on the DF command line.
In the visual development environment, specify the Predefined Preprocessor
Symbols in the General or Preprocessor Compiler Option Category.
You can use the directives to detect symbol definitions, such as the IF Directive
Construct. Like certain other compiler options, an equivalent directive exists
(DEFINE directive).
The following preprocessor symbols are predefined by the compiler system and
are available to compiler directives and FPP (except _DF_VERSION_ and
_VF_VERSION_):
Predefined Preprocessor Symbols
Predefined Symbol Name
and Value Conditions When this Symbol is Defined
_DF_VERSION_=660 (660 for
Version 6.6) Compiler only
_DLL=1 Only if /libs:dll, /MDs, /MD, /dll, or /LD is
specified, but not when /libs:static is
specified
_INTEGRAL_MAX_BITS=32 Only for ia32 (32-bit) systems
_INTEGRAL_MAX_BITS=64 Only for ia64 (64-bit) systemsCompiler and Linker Options

_ITANIUM_A3_=1 Only for ia64 (64-bit) systems
_MSFORTRAN_=401 Only if /fpscomp:symbols is specified or you
use the FL32 command
_MT=1 Only if /threads or /MT is specified
_M_IX86=500 Only for ia32 (32-bit) systems
_M_IA64=64100 Only for ia64 (64-bit) systems
_VF_VERSION_=660 (660 for
Version 6.6) Compiler only
_WIN32=1 Always defined (both ia32 and ia64
systems)
_WIN64=1 Only for ia64 (64-bit) systems
_WIN95=1 Only for ia32 (32-bit) systems running the
Windows 95 operating system
_WIN98=1 Only for ia32 (32-bit) systems running the
Windows 98 operating system
_WINME=1 Only for ia32 (32-bit) systems running the
Windows Me operating system
_X86_=1 Only for ia32 (32-bit) systems
